Console:
 * add cursor struct and renderer
 * add history option with arrow keys
 * add a setoutput function to display debug in the game console

Messenger:
 * Maybe an xml file that can do string search based callback functions?

GameApplication:
 * Add like a global configuration class, so messenger can access it and modify it at runtime

Still want to add cool stuff like:
 * I need to add components to the game. Like a model is now a component added to a list...
 	* 8/8 Update: Done! works good, wondering if I even need the renderedgameobject class
 * Generating gameObjects in the console, so you can add some simple models
 * Creating a scene class to load and unload models and gameObjects
 * Fix gameObject class to allow the thing above
 * add in animations for models
 * add in a physics engine and apply it to gameObjects
 * more lighting. Some real good gl lighting effects
 * material classes
 * normal mapping


8/8:
I addded a logging class using the boost log library. May require users to have the library installed. 
Or I can release it with the .so and .dll. I still fully plan to let this cross compile on windows and 
linux. What game engine just runs on linux? Lol. Also I really need to get the gameScene idea going. I
plan on having some sort of save feature. An XML file can be generated holding in all of the game info 
that is relevant from load to load and can be saved for making game levels (inclusive with the game 
scene idea). Also I'm thinking of making an action class derived from the game component. This could
be the class that is inherited to add to game objects for users to make and should be movable between
objects. Implementing the save idea with the xml file should make this a pretty smooth process. Also
I need a way to get a list of all the components at compile time. With this, a gameObject can be added
while the game is running. And that game object can be enumerated with components from the pre compiled
database at runtime. Also I really need to implement a time class that is configured at the
GameApplication level and is usuable in the base gameComponent class. This can contain the delta times 
for a renderer update and a physics update. 

Also what would be cool is a way to abstract the camera class. Such that it can be applied to an object
or it can be used in the editor for exploring. Then you can start and stop the game whenever you please
and get a camera of the world (free to move around and do cool shit) and the players camera.
