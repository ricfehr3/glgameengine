Console:
 * add cursor struct and renderer
 * add history option with arrow keys
 * add a setoutput function to display debug in the game console

Messenger:
 * Maybe an xml file that can do string search based callback functions?

GameApplication:
 * Add like a global configuration class, so messenger can access it and modify it at runtime

Still want to add cool stuff like:
 * I need to add components to the game. Like a model is now a component added to a list...
 * Generating gameObjects in the console, so you can add some simple models
 * Creating a scene class to load and unload models and gameObjects
 * Fix gameObject class to allow the thing above
 * add in animations for models
 * add in a physics engine and apply it to gameObjects
 * more lighting. Some real good gl lighting effects
 * material classes
 * normal mapping


more to come
